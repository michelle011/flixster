### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I think the topics discussed in labs were obviously very relevant to completing the assignment, but because of the nature of the scheduling this week I personally felt rushed and I will be needing the extension to let the topics sink in and to successfully complete the project. I felt unprepared to complete the features involving the API mostly. The Giphy Party lab was definitely helpful to learn about APIs but there is more components of the project that I haven't fully taken in. The big challenge for me was achieving the correct syntax; for example, I know I will need multiple different API urls depending on what function of the website I will be focused on, but I still need to clarify how to actually implement these URLs within my code and functions. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
With the extra time over the weekend, I will be reviewing concepts that will help me finish the project to get a minimum viable product (MVP, like Nick said). Then I will revisit this question.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I will revisit this question when resubmitting, 

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.
Shout out to Adriana and Eva! They have been really nice and helpful while we work things out and offer suggestions together. Also shoutout to Moe for the topic review lesson on Thursday, it really helped me better understand important concepts and also see what correct syntax looks like.
